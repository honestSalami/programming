akkartik's mission
http://akkartik.name/about
to help people understand code faster, to make that nicer
"all software should reward curiosity"
"focus on helping the outsider comprehend a project"
"a new language or tool will have at best a short term effect
unless we're able to keep the big picture of our codebase comprehensible over
time as members join and leave it"
causes of creeping accidental complexity:
    backwards compatibility
    churn of personnel
    vestigial features
solutions:
    be friendly to outsiders
    be rewrite friendly
    lots of test, at every level of the stack
    white box testing. Testing everything affected by the function, not just
        its return value

Mu, a tiny new machine
https://github.com/akkartik/mu
an interesting experiment in literate programming

literate programming: knuth is doing it wrong
http://akkartik.name/post/literate-programming
organization of the code is more important than typesetting

learnable programming

designing a programming system for understanding programs
bret victor
programming is a way of thinking, not a rote skill
people understand what they can see
how do we get people to understand programming?
we change programming. We turn it into something that's understandable by people

wikilon introduction
https://awelonblue.wordpress.com/2014/09/29/introducing-wikilon/
a wiki inspired software platform and developmen environment
a wiki based IDE and live software platform
you can have a transactional view not only of the codebase, 
but also of the many web apps hosting it.
so, users can edit a codebase, see a live impact on their web applications,
and preserve this as a personal session view until they wish to share the 
changes by commiting them.

programming with mydef
https://huizhou.gitbooks.io/programming-with-mydef/
a balance between being precize (doing exactly the thing we tell them)
and being able to guess what we want.
between doing things consistently and guessing what we want them to do.
mydef is the upper layer that can guess, and whatever language you are using
is the lower layer, the accurate one

Separation of mechanism and policy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_mechanism_and_policy
a design principle in computer science.
the way to do it does not limit what you can do.
like the X windowing system does not tell you how windows should look,
only how you can draw pixels on the screen

Separation of concerns
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns
each part of the program deals with one concern

the Scheme underground
https://github.com/scheme
a repository of some interesting scheme things, like:
a regular expression engine based on SRE notation
scsh
soosy, a Object Oriented system
